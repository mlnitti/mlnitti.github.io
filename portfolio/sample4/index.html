          The first assignment in which we were instructed to alter an advertisement, I chose to work with the Crest toothpaste advertisement. The slogan on the picture said “Give your kids a fighting chance.” And it has a child frowning holding a toothbrush and Crest toothpaste. I decided to change some of the color up to make the slogan pop a bit more to start. Then I crossed out the ‘ting’ in ‘fighting’ and I also crossed out ‘chance’ so the slogan read, “Give your kids a fight.” I purposely crossed out those words but kept them visible and legible so it looked as if someone had done graffiti on it. My thought process is that some kids growing up can be rebellious towards their parents when it comes to performing routines that aren’t fun, like brushing your teeth. So “Give your kids a fight” is supposed to entail fighting your kids to brush their teeth daily. I compared the two as having very different messages/meanings as a way to make it clear that these should be looked at as distinct from one another.
