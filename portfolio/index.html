        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Upon taking this course, I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect. I knew that I wanted to further my abilities to create content digitally, whether that was with photoshop, video editing, etc. Learning HTML was a challenge for me. Initially, I did not understand why it was important. I felt that making a website this way was just a more complicated process than using a user-friendly website making application, like Wix. However, I came to realize that isn’t necessarily true. Although using something like Wix may be easier, HTML allows you to do more with what you envision.</br><br>

Working through this Work-in-Progress 1 assignment has proved to be quite the challenge for me. Coming into this semester, I haven’t had any experience at all using HTML, CSS or Github. I still feel as if there is an astronomical amount to learn about web design, coding, etc, but my Github page so far has given me some confidence in my ability to learn and adapt. Despite that, this was an incredibly frustrating assignment to work through, but that made it all the more worthwhile working through it and completing the assignment to this point.</br><br>

The writing assignments I’ve had to do for this class have definitely come the easiest to me. Because I have been writing relatively consistently since my junior year of high school, I take pride in the writing assignments I do for school. Outside of writing assignments for school, I mostly write sports-related articles. So, although this is a very different style of writing, I still feel comfortable and confident with my abilities to put together quality work.</br><br>

The website design I had went through minor revisions. I changed the color scheme, fonts, and alignment of content. I define revision as change for the intention of improvement. I think change is only necessary if it improves the quality of something, whether that be with design, functionality, etc. I also believe revisions can not always work, and thus be revised or reverted back. Overall, my revisions got my site where I want it to be, which revolves around its simplicity. </br><br>

I wanted to make my website accessible to everyone. Every function of my website is designed for ease of use and navigation. My navigation bar is straightforward with a few sub-navigation bars. My target audience has no limitations.

Peer review was interesting. It was the first opinion I got regarding my site that wasn’t my own, which is a good thing. Obviously, I want my site to convey the vision I have, but I also realize it’s important to have the awareness that the connection between my vision and my actual website can really only be recognized by myself. So, having that other viewpoint is vital to knowing what outsiders see.

Looking back at the work that I put into the Work In Progress 2 assignment, and then comparing it to the Work In Progress 1, I’ve noticed some similarities and differences between the process of working through both. For the first WIP, I had a lot of trouble understanding HTML and how you can do several different things with it. It was an entirely new task for me to wrap my head around, and frankly, it would get frustrating. However, what I noticed with both WIPs is that there is great satisfaction in correctly inputting the functions that create my page the way I want it. It’s cool to see that my website has come this far and now after WIP 2, I feel confident about the evolution of my website.</br><br>

The only major assignment we had following the WIP2 was the Pecha Kucha. For me, that was my favorite assignment in the class. With most principles of design, I’d say I comprehend the basics of it all. I know that each principle plays a significant role in web design, whether it’s subtle or not. But, being able to focus on just one principle allowed me to really dive deep into its importance. I’m especially happy that it was iteration.</br><br>

For better or worse, everyone in the class had their site go through an iteration period. Typing a command, committing, and refreshing. Going back and changing the command to do something else. It’s all a part of the iteration process.
