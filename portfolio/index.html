        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Michael Nitti. I’m currently enrolled as a senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Media and Professional Communications in the College of General Studies and will graduate in April of 2020. On campus, I’ve been involvedwith the student-operated radio station, WPTS Radio, since the start of my sophomore year, and in May of 2019, I was named the Sports Director. I coordinate all of our sports programming, host and produce two one-hour long sports talk shows every week, and conduct sports staff meetings. Additionally, I do play-by-play and color commentary for some of our football and basketball broadcasts. In the past, I’ve contributed as a writer for a couple different publications. I was a member of the sports staff atthe student-operated newspaper on campus, The Pitt News. I wrote game coverages/recaps, personal interviews, and analysis-based articles. I have also written for Rum Bunter, a Pittsburgh Pirates blog that is part of the greater collection of sports blogs called FanSided. My biggest passion is sports, which has led me to my pursuit of a career in sports media, whether it be radio, print, or television.</p>
