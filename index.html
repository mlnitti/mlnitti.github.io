        <center><h2>About Me</h2></center>
        <p>My name is Michael Nitti. I’m currently enrolled as a senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Media and Professional Communications in the College of General Studies and will graduate in April of 2020.</br></br> 
          On campus, I’ve been involved with the student-operated radio station, WPTS Radio, since the start of my sophomore year, and in May of 2019, I was named the Sports Director. I coordinate all of our sports programming, host and produce two one-hour long sports talk shows every week, and work with other directors at the station on general projects. Additionally, I do play-by-play and color commentary for some of our football and basketball broadcasts.</br></br> 
          In the past, I’ve contributed as a writer for a couple different publications. I was a member of the sports staff atthe student-operated newspaper on campus, The Pitt News. I wrote game coverages/recaps, personal interviews, and analysis-based articles. I have also written for Rum Bunter, a Pittsburgh Pirates blog that is part of the greater collection of sports blogs called FanSided.</br></br> 
          My biggest passion is sports, which has led me to my pursuit of a career in sports media, whether it be radio, print, or television.</p>
