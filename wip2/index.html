        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Looking back at the work that I put into the Work In Progress 2 assignment, and then comparing it to the Work In Progress 1, I’ve noticed some similarities and differences between the process of working through both. For the first WIP, I had a lot of trouble understanding HTML and how you can do several different things with it. It was an entirely new task for me to wrap my head around, and frankly, it would get frustrating. However, what I noticed with both WIPs is that there is great satisfaction in correctly inputting the functions that create my page the way I want it. It’s cool to see that my website has come this far and now after WIP 2, I feel confident about expanding my website, if I so please.</br><br> 

The first assignment in which we were instructed to alter an advertisement, I chose to work with the Crest toothpaste advertisement. The slogan on the picture said “Give your kids a fighting chance.” And it has a child frowning holding a toothbrush and Crest toothpaste. I decided to change some of the color up to make the slogan pop a bit more to start. Then I crossed out the ‘ting’ in ‘fighting’ and I also crossed out ‘chance’ so the slogan read, “Give your kids a fight.” I purposely crossed out those words but kept them visible and legible so it looked as if someone had done graffiti on it. My thought process is that some kids growing up can be rebellious towards their parents when it comes to performing routines that aren’t fun, like brushing your teeth. So “Give your kids a fight” is supposed to entail fighting your kids to brush their teeth daily.</br><br> 

The second assignment was the genre remix. I chose to remix one of The Dark Knight posters, specifically the one with Heath Ledger as Joker on it. The Dark Knight is considered an action/adventure superhero film. The first thing I thought of when I decided to do The Dark Knight was the famous painting by Van Gogh, Starry Night. So I cropped Joker out of the original poster and put him on a copy of the painting and called it “A Starry Knight.” This new genre I would consider to be something like a documentary on Van Gogh, played by Heath Ledger. </br><br> 

The third assignment was the storyboard. My fictional documentary was based on the iteration of the cell phone. After doing my Pecha Kucha on iteration, I felt it was best to base my storyboard off that principle as well. My story mostly details the evolution of the design of cell phones, Steve Jobs, and how cell phones have greatly affected social interaction. The cell phone has become a very integral part of nearly everyone’s lives across the world, so I thought a documentary about it would be an interesting idea.</br><br>  

The fourth and most recent assignment was the logo/wordmark creation. I created a fictional app called Venue Navigator. I used the V and the N as the letters for my logo. I positioned the bottom of the V to fit between the right-hand valley in the N. I then put dotted lines between the letters to indicate a path. I used green because most of the people using the app would be at sports stadiums so it represents grass. The idea of the app is to allow people at sports stadiums, concert venues and convention centers to find their way around a venue. The app would map out exits, bathrooms, sections, vendors and so on. It would then give the best and most efficient path. The purpose is to save people time from aimlessly walking around a stadium not knowing where to go.</br><br>  

Overall, I enjoyed working through WIP2 more than WIP1. I felt more comfortable with HTML, although it was a bit of a challenge getting the photos in, but once I figured it out I felt good about what I created.
