    <h2>Original Desing Concept</h2>
    <p>I think there’s several different designs and styles of websites that can be considered good designs. I also believe that it has to do with the content of the website as well. Not all websites have to incorporate colors that pop or graphics that stand out,and not all website need to have expansive navigation features.For my website, I want to have a navigation bar at the top that isn’t too complicated. Each tab would either be a single click to get to that page or would have a simple drop-down menu with sub tabs. In terms of color schemes, I would probably use mostly neutral colors as well as white as a heavy accent. I don’t want to put too much content on one single page. Some websites fill as much empty space as they can on one page, but I don’t want mine to be cluttered. I would like to use some empty space strategically to make all the pages more digestible and easier to look at.</p>
