    <h2>Original Design Concept</h2>
    <p>I think there’s several different designs and styles of websites that can be considered good designs. I also believe that it has to do with the content of the website as well. Not all websites have to incorporate colors that pop or graphics that stand out, and not all website need to have expansive navigation features.</br><br> 
      
      For my website, I want to have a navigation bar at the top that isn’t too complicated. Each tab would either be a single click to get to that page or would have a simple drop-down menu with sub tabs. In terms of color schemes, I would probably use mostly neutral colors as well as white as a heavy accent. I don’t want to put too much content on one single page. Some websites fill as much empty space as they can on one page, but I don’t want mine to be cluttered. I would like to use some empty space strategically to make all the pages more digestible and easier to look at.</p>
    <h2>Revised Design Concept</h2>
    <p>For the most part, my vision for my website design and structure has remained the same. I want to incorporate mostly neutral colors while also having enough contrast between them. Additionally, I really would like to add some dimensional depth to my website. I want things to pop out more, but not with fancy fonts or flashy colors, but with techniques used to create depth and texture. I don’t want my website to feel super flat.</br><br>

I also want my page to have some symmetry and balance. I don’t want too much content on one side of a page and way less on the other. It should feel consistent throughout, page-to-page.</br><br> 

For my navigation bar, I still want it to be simple and at the top of the page going across horizontally.</br><br> 

Websites have varying styles and layouts, and I don’t think there’s a right or wrong format to follow based on what the content is. I think functionality is the most crucial aspect of any site. Being able to navigate a website relatively seamlessly is important to me.
