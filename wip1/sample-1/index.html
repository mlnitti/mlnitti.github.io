    <h2>Original Embedded Fiction</h2>
    <p>Amazon Parody Review: Echo Dot (Alexa)</br><br> I purchased this Echo Dot about a month ago, and it’s given me nothing but trouble. They advertise it as a personal assistant at home, but it does nothing I want it to. I’ll say, “Alexa, do my taxes,” and it’ll say “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.”</br><br> It can play music I tell it to, turn the lights on and off when I tell it to, and anything else I can easily do on my own. But when I want it to do something I don’t want to spend my time on, all I get is her saying “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.”Sounds like my ex-wife. It won’t file my divorce papers either, on that matter.</br><br> “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.” No, I’M SORRY I wasted my money on you, money I worked hard to earn, for you.</br><br> 0 out of 5 stars, don’t get fooled by those commercials on the TV.</p>
    <h2>Revised Embedded Fiction</h2>
    <p>Amazon Parody Review: Echo Dot (Alexa)</br><br>

Recently, I got myself one of them Echo Dots. My kids have been begging for it, so I thought, why not?</br><br>

However, I’ve ran into some problems.</br><br>

It only does things that I could’ve just as easily done on my own in not that much longer of a time frame. I know how to turn the damn lights on and off, and I know how to pause and play music. I don’t quite get it.</br><br>
It can’t do things that I need help with. Like doing my taxes. Or putting on my socks. I thought this thing was supposed to be my personal assistant?</br><br>
Lastly, the worst part of this thing by far, is that my wife’s name is Alexa!</br><br> 

All in all, I want my money back. 0/5 stars.</p>
