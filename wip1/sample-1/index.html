    <p>Amazon Parody Review: Echo Dot (Alexa)
      
      I purchased this Echo Dot about a month ago, and it’s given me nothing but trouble. They advertise it as a personal assistant at home, but it does nothing I want it to. I’ll say, “Alexa, do my taxes,” and it’ll say “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.” It can play music I tell it to, turn the lights on and off when I tell it to, and anything else I can easily do on my own. But when I want it to do something I don’t want to spend my time on, all I get is her saying “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.”Sounds like my ex-wife. It won’t file my divorce papers either, on that matter. “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.” No, I’M SORRY I wasted my money on you, money I worked hard to earn, for you. 
      
      0 out of 5 stars, don’t get fooled by those commercials on the TV.</p>
