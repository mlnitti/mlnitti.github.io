        <p>Working through this Work-in-Progress 1 assignment has proved to be quite the challenge for me. Coming into this semester, I haven’t had any experience at all using HTML, CSS or Github. I still feel as if there is an astronomical amount to learn about web design, coding, etc, but my Github page so far has given me some confidence in my ability to learn and adapt. Despite that, this was an incredibly frustrating assignment to work through, but that made it all the more worthwhile working through it and completing the assignment to this point.</br><br>

The writing assignments I’ve had to do for this class have definitely come the easiest to me. Because I have been writing relatively consistently since my junior year of high school, I take pride in the writing assignments I do for school. Outside of writing assignments for school, I mostly write sports-related articles. So, although this is a very different style of writing, I still feel comfortable and confident with my abilities to put together quality work.</br><br>

The layout of my website is relatively basic and straight-forward. I have the same header at the top of each page, displaying “Michael Nitti’s Github Pages Site.” I felt that it was important that it consistently stayed there to serve as a reminder of where the user is. Most website’s often have the name of the site/company/brand somewhere on the screen at all times.</br><br> 

For the color scheme, I wanted to keep it simple. I wanted the site to be easy on the eyes, and I didn’t want any one part of the screen at any moment to be too distracting. I went with a dark grey as the background color for a couple of reasons. For one, it’s neutral, so it doesn’t pop out too much. It provides a nice canvas for the other components of the site to layover. Additionally, it’s not white. It would have been easy to with white, but I didn’t want the site to feel like it was printer paper.</br><br>

For the headers, I opted to go with dark blue. Another neutral color, dark blue is different enough from black to make it distinct. At the same time, dark blue doesn’t jump out at you to make it distracting or strenuous to look at. As for the bodies of text, I stuck with black. I felt that if I went with dark blue again, I would be blending too much of the page together, and if I went with another color, it would potentially contrast too much with the rest of the page.</br><br>

For the top navigation bar. I took the liberty of adding borders, or what I would prefer to consider as dividers. This was the toughest thing for me to execute. Initially, I had one border between each menu item, but it wasn’t centered between the two, so it looked bad and very uneven. So, I compromised by adding a border to each side of each menu item. Doing so created symmetry amongst the navigation bar.</br><br> 

At first, the borders were just solid black lines, but I wanted to experiment with other textures. First, I tried the dotted lines and I liked how they looked but I wanted more contrast between the lines. So, I decided to try dashed lines as well. Now, they alternate and I like how it gives distinct separation between the words without being overbearing on the page.</br><br> 

For font choices, I went with Rockwell for my main header and my subheaders. I think it provides my page with a little more character. If I chose a more generic font, I think my site would be too boring and plain. For the body of texts, I went with Calibri. I felt that it was a bit better looking than fonts such as Arial and Times New Roman, but it was also simple and easy to read too.</br><br> 

Moving forward, there’s much more I want to add to my site to make it better. One specific thing that I want to learn how to do is create more depth. In another course I’m taking, Integrating Writing and Design, we use Adobe InDesign to create different kinds of documents. One of the key components of some design is using texture and depth. For me, HTML is much more challenging than InDesign, but I still believe I can create depth with HTML.</br><br>

As of right now, my site is very two-dimensional, and given the simplicity of my site, creating depth will help me make my site more distinct.</br><br>
